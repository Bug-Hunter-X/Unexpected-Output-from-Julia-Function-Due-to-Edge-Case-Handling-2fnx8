# Julia Function Edge Case Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in Julia functions: improper handling of edge cases. The function `my_function` fails to correctly process values around the boundary condition (x == 10).  The solution demonstrates a more robust approach that addresses these cases.  This bug can easily lead to unexpected program behavior, especially in numerical computation.

## Bug
The provided Julia code contains a function that produces unexpected results because of how it handles edge cases. 

## Solution
The solution includes a corrected function that specifically considers the boundary condition to guarantee correct and expected output.
